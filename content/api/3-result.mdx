The `pg.Result` shape is returned for every successful query.

<div className="alert alert-info">note: you cannot instantiate this directly</div>

## `result.rows: Array<any>`

Every result will have a rows array. If no rows are returned the array will be empty. Otherwise the array will contain one item for each row returned from the query. By default node-postgres creates a map from the name to value of each column, giving you a json-like object back for each row.

## `result.fields: Array<FieldInfo>`

Every result will have a fields array. This array contains the `name` and `dataTypeId` of each field in the result. These fields are ordered in the same order as the columns if you are using `arrayMode` for the query:

```js
const { Pool } = require('pg')

const pool = new Pool()

const client = await pool.connect()
const result = await client.query({
  rowMode: 'array',
  text: 'SELECT 1 as one, 2 as two;',
})
console.log(result.fields[0].name) // one
console.log(result.fields[1].name) // two
console.log(result.rows) // [1, 2]
await client.end()
```

## `result.rowCount: int`

The number of rows processed by the last command.

## `result.command: string`

The command type last executed: `INSERT` `UPDATE` `CREATE` `SELECT` etc.
